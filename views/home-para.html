So instead of using XML to describe a bean wiring, you can move the bean configuration into the component class itself by using annotations on the relevant class, method, or field declaration. Annotation injection is performed before XML injection, thus the latter configuration will override the former for properties wired through both approaches. Annotation wiring is not turned on in the Spring container by default. So, before we can use annotation-based wiring, we will need to enable it in our Spring configuration file. So consider to have following configuration file in case you want to use any annotation in your Spring application.</p>
